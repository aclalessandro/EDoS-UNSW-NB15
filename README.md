Database EDoS-UNSW-NB15

The UNSW-NB15 dataset, developed by Moustafa and Slay (2015), includes various types of cloud-based attacks. Over five months, we manually identified Economic Denial of Sustainability (EDoS) attacks based on the characteristics described by Zhijun et al. (2020) and the UNSW-NB15 report (link: https://acesse.dev/TXW9u). 

The attacks found include ICMP Flood, TCP SYN Flood, DNS Flood, UDP Flood, and HTTP Flood, which exhibit denial-of-service characteristics, as well as EDoS attacks with LDoS characteristics, such as Slowloris, XXE, and BREACH. The EDoS attacks were labeled as "EDOS," creating a new attack category in the dataset, which is available in this repository.
